							<td id="grayson1" class="text-center"> Richard Grayson is the first holder of the Robin mantle, taught by Batman. His backstory starts the day his parents died in an accident in the circus when he was a kid. His family was known as "The Flying Graysons" in the circus. One day, there was a malfunction with the equipment his parents were using, causing them to plummet to the ground in front of the crowd of spectators during their show. Bruce Wayne -- otherwise known as Batman -- was there to witness it happen, and took in Richard Grayson as his ward. In the future, Richard Grayson grows to become "Nightwing", leaving his Robin days behind and becoming one of the elites. </td>

							<td id="todd0" class="text-center">Jason Todd: "The Dead Robin"</td>
							<td id="todd1" class="text-center"> Jason Todd was the second kid to hold the Robin title after Richard Grayson. After Grayson left Wayne Manor to live his own life (eventually becoming his own hero), Batman picked up Jason Todd when the kid attempted to steal the wheels off of the Batmobile. Batman adopted him, and raised him to be a Robin. Unfortunately, Jason Todd's Robin era came to a miserable end when he was murdered by Batman's nemesis -- The Joker. In a twist of events, Jason resurrected from the dead using the Lazarus Pit and became a crime lord in Gotham, turning his back on Bruce for failing to save him. He became "Red Hood". </td>

							<td id="drake0" class="text-center">Timothy Drake: "The Investigative Robin"</td>
							<td id="drake1" class="text-center"> Timothy Drake -- better known as Tim Drake -- is the third kid to hold the Robin title. In the comics, he grows up in a wealthy yet absent family. After the death of his parents, he becomes the sole owner to the Drake assets. However, a two fun facts about Tim is that he loves photography, and he love the Bats (Batman and his Robins). He admired them so much that just by his photos of them alone, he found out their secret identities. Impressed by this, Batman takes him in to "replace" the dead Jason Todd. Tim becomes more of an investigative Robin rather than a combat specialist, unlike his predecessors. Nonetheless, he wields the bo staff honorably. In the future, he gives up being "Robin" and becomes "Red Robin". </td>

							<td id="steph1" class="text-center"> Stephanie Brown is the first female Robin to appear in the comics. She was able to convince Batman to make her a Robin. She, however, was not as capable as the Robins before her. Due to this, she was dismissed from the position. With a new goal in mind -- which was to be her own hero and spoil her villainous father's plans -- she was able to adopt a new name, "Spoiler". She is often forgotten as a Robin due to her lackluster in comparison to the male Robins. </td>

From since he was a baby, up until he was 10, he was trained to be a child solider. An assassin for the League of Shadows. After that, he was sent by his mother to live with his father. There, he took up the Robin mantle with pride, using his abilities for the good of Gotham City. </td>
